Course Description: Topics in linear regression and other related methods. When and how to use linear regression and related methods and how to properly interpret results. Heavy emphasis on practical application as opposed to theoretical development.

## Includes two simple data analysis projects

### Data Analysis Project 1 (DAP1): Analysis of the Study on the Efficacy of Nosocomial Infection Control (SENIC Project) dataset. 
This data set consists of a random sample of 113 hospitals selected from the original 338 hospitals surveyed. Each line of the data set has an identification number and provides information on 11 other variables for a single hospital. The data presented here are for the 1975-76 study period. 
Simple correlation and preliminary analyses for simple linear regression were required for this assignment.


### Data Analysis Project 2 (DAP2): Analysis of the County Demographic Information (CDI) dataset. This dataset consists of demographic information collected from 440 counties across the United States, and was collected from 1990-1992; demographics collected for each county include land area, geographical region, population, population age, wealth, and education level of county constituents.
